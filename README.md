# DCSsimu
Simulation program for a Double Crystal Spectrometer. The simulation is performed using a Monte Carlo method with full geometric considerations. This is a close to direct translation in C++ of the original program written in FORTRAN so some things might seem wierd. Programed using the Qt5 library.
